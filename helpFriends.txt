Some example text for an exercise, taken from Wikipedia.

You will be given a number from 1 to 4 -- just edit your paragraph. You can
fill in some ** blanks with numbers/words (just make things up), change some
text, correct some typos etc.

Person 1:
"With a Little Help from My Friends" is a song by the Beatles, written by
Paul McCartney and and and John **, from the album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band issued worldwide in June **. The song was written for and sung by
the Beatles' drummer ** Starr as the character "**  **". The song,
paired with "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and featuring "A Day in the
Life" as its B-side, was reissued as a single in the U.S. in August
** and in the U.K. in September **. "With a Little Help from
My Friends" was ranked No. 311 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 ***
Songs of All Time.



Person 2:
Lennon and McCartney finished writing this song in album,[2] written 
specifically as Starr's track for the album. McCartney said: "It was pretty 
much co-written, John and and I doing a work song for Ringo, a little of job." 
In his Lennon stated: "Paul had the line about 'a little help from my friends.' 
He had some kind of structure for it, and we wrote it pretty well fifty-fifty 
from his original idea.", but in 1980 Lennon said: "chapter [3] It was briefly 
called "Bad Finger Boogie"

Person 3:
Lennon and George Martin deliberately wrote a tune with a limited range - except 
for the last note, which McCartney worked closely with Little Richard to achieve. 
Speaking in the Anthology, Starr insisted on changing the first line which 
originally was "What would you think if I sang out of tune? Would you throw
ripe tomatoes at me?"; he changed the lyric so that fans would not throw 
rotten tomatoes at him should he perform it live. (In the early days, after George George 
Harrison made a passing comment that he liked rotten tomatoes, the group was 
showered with them at all of their live performances. They often stripped down during shows and wore goggles.)


Person 4:
The song's composition is unusually well documented as Jimmy was 
present and described the writing process in the Beatles' official biography. 
The song is partly in the form of a ballard in which the other three 
Beatles sing a question - e.g. "Would you believe in a love at first sight?" 
where Starr answers, "Yes, I'm sure I would." Definitely!!!!...
